# XssDetectionUsingIds
Cross-Site Scripting (known as XSS) attack using Intrusion Detection system (IDS). This work focuses on the detection of XSS attack using intrusion detection system. Here attack signature is utilized to detect XSS attack. To test the usefulness and effectiveness of proposed work a proof of concept prototype has been implemented using SNORT IDS. It is observed that proposed system correctly detected XSS attack.
